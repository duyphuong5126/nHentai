# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - images/ic_lang_jp.png
   - images/ic_lang_gb.png
   - images/ic_lang_cn.png
   - images/ic_nhentai_logo.svg
   - images/ic_nothing_here_grey.png
   - images/ic_loading_cat_transparent.gif
   - images/ic_un_seen.svg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: NotoSans_Bold
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/NotoSans_Bold.ttf

    - family: NotoSans_BoldItalic
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/NotoSans_BoldItalic.ttf

    - family: NotoSans_Italic
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/NotoSans_Italic.ttf

    - family: NotoSans_Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/NotoSans_Regular.ttf
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
